    "text": "Hi there!\nI’m Zachary, and I earned my Ph.D. in chemical physics under the guidance of William (Bill) McCurdy. Our group also included Tom Rescigno and Robert Lucchese—or as I like to call them, “the three McKoy boys!” I came up with this nickname to honor Vince McKoy, under whom they all studied. My research focused on non-relativistic scattering calculations of small molecules. Specifically, my thesis explored one-photon double ionization of \\(H_2O\\).\nIf you’re interested in learning more about my Ph.D. research, feel free to check out my Google Scholar. You can also explore these insightful lectures by Bill and Robert. Moreover, here’s a fun project to solve a 1-D Schrodinger equation for an arbitrary potential on any interval using a FEM-DVR grid all in python!\nOver the past few years, I’ve been working in the AI industry. As I immersed myself in the field, I often found that many of the concepts being discussed were strikingly similar to ideas I had encountered during my academic career—just wrapped in a different jargon. This realization inspired me to start this blog.\nThrough this space, I aim to bridge the gap between the intricate language of modern AI and the foundational principles I know from my background in physics. My goal is to unravel the complexities of deep learning, strip away the buzzwords, and distill everything down to ab initio understanding.",
