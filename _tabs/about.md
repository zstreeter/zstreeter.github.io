Hi there! ✌️

I'm Zachary, and I earned my Ph.D. in chemical physics under the guidance of William (Bill) McCurdy. Our group also included Tom Rescigno and Robert Lucchese—or as I like to call them, "the three McKoy boys!" I came up with this nickname to honor Vince McKoy, under whom they all studied. My research focused on non-relativistic scattering calculations of small molecules. Specifically, my thesis explored one-photon double ionization of $$H_2O$$.

If you're interested in learning more about my Ph.D. research, feel free to check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=09Qx2XoAAAAJ&hl=en). You can also explore these insightful lectures by [Bill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UomfhNfjfwU&start=0) and [Robert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78_xNYUbeqM&start=0). Moreover, here's a fun [project](https://quantumgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to solve a 1-D Schrödinger equation for an arbitrary potential on any interval using a FEM-DVR grid all in python!

Over the past few years, I've been working in the AI industry. As I immersed myself in the field, I often found that many of the concepts being discussed were strikingly similar to ideas I had encountered during my academic career—just wrapped in a different jargon. This realization inspired me to start this blog.

Through this space, I aim to bridge the gap between the intricate language of modern AI and the foundational principles I know from my background in physics. My goal is to unravel the complexities of deep learning, strip away the buzzwords, and distill everything down to ab initio understanding.
